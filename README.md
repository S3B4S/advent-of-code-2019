# Advent of Code 2019

My attempts at tackling the challenges of [this years Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019]! :)

## Set up locally

1. Clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/S3B4S/advent-of-code-2019.git
```
2. Run `npm i`

Note, I've only run the challenges in Node 13.3.

## Run solutions
The solutions have been created locally and run in Node 13.3.
At the root of the project, run the command
```
$ node <CHALLENGE-TO-RUN>
```
for example
```
$ node day-01
```
will run the submission to the challenge of the first day.
